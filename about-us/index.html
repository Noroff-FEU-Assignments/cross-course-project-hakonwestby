      <h2>About GameHub:</h2>
      <p>
        GameHub is an organization that takes pride in helping gamers across the
        world get their hands on cheaper alternatives to video games with the
        same amount of quality to them. We let the customer sell their used
        games to other intrigued gamers looking to expand their library.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process is straight forward, a person can make an account and list
        their game in our "Used Games" section. Any potential buyers can then
        place that game into their shopping cart and buy it from that person. We
        are the middlemen in the process and will send the seller a detailed
        sticker to place on the game's packaging that will send it to us and we
        will ensure a safe receival by the third party and also cover all
        shipping costs through our 5% middleman fee! This means you will get 95%
        of your desired price with no shipping costs at all!
